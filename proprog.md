**A list of the name of the students in the team**
The bachelor team was:
- Stian Sørslett
- Benjamin Skinstad

But only I (Stian) have professional programming this semester. 

**A list of links to any other repos connected to the project**

I have added any snippets of code I go through in discussion in this repo, so no links needed.

**Group discussion**
**Strenghts and weaknesses of languages you used in your project:**

Our application is made using Unity. Therefore we only have a few choices of language as far as we understand, and only one of them seems to be the obvious choice. The main choices, maybe only choices actually, is C# and UnityScript (which is a Unity version of javascript), and we decided on using C#. There seem to be an even mix of documentation so that's not really a point to which we pick after. C# is a very popular language, so it's easy to find questions and answers online if we need to google something. It is widely used and therefore has good documentation in our opinion. It is object oriented which we feel is a plus. We can’t really think of weaknesses for it. We know one weakness is that it is very Windows oriented, but that doesn’t really matter to us as Unity helps make the application available on the platforms we want supported. 

**How you controlled process and communication systems during development**

To start off we were a very small group, only two people. This provided both challenges and boons. On the development side I would say it was bad at times because of the little amount of manpower we had to work with, being half the amount of people a lot of the other bachelor groups were. We do however think that on the side of communication it was easier for us. This because we were less people to account for and less opinions to keep track of. I have several times used trello or other boards as a way to keep track of tasks needed to be done, and to keep track of work we need to do during sprints and the likes. Under the bachelor however, we opted away from this. Our reasons for this were a couple. Firstly, and probably most importantly, we thought the reward for keeping the board fed and updated was more work than needed for two people, and secondly, we felt the communication channels we already were using were adequate. 
So what we ended up using was mainly discord, where we created our own chat for tracking work, talking about ideas and keeping track of notes and documents. We also had a work diagram we went through every five weeks to see if we were on track, what was left, what we were going to do in the next sprint and what we had to cut. These two have felt sufficient for us through the entire process. Now, i don’t think this is a valid route to go for everyone as a discord channel can get cluttered very fast with multiple people. But we do think this was a valid option for our 2 man team.
