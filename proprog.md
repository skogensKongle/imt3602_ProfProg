**A list of the name of the students in the team**
The bachelor team was:
- Stian Sørslett
- Benjamin Skinstad

But only I (Stian) have professional programming this semester. 

**A list of links to any other repos connected to the project**

I have added any snippets of code I go through in discussion in this repo, so no links needed.

**Group discussion**
**Strenghts and weaknesses of languages you used in your project:**

Our application is made using Unity. Therefore we only have a few choices of language as far as we understand, and only one of them seems to be the obvious choice. The main choices, maybe only choices actually, is C# and UnityScript (which is a Unity version of javascript), and we decided on using C#. There seem to be an even mix of documentation so that's not really a point to which we pick after. C# is a very popular language, so it's easy to find questions and answers online if we need to google something. It is widely used and therefore has good documentation in our opinion. It is object oriented which we feel is a plus. We can’t really think of weaknesses for it. We know one weakness is that it is very Windows oriented, but that doesn’t really matter to us as Unity helps make the application available on the platforms we want supported. 

**How you controlled process and communication systems during development**

To start off we were a very small group, only two people. This provided both challenges and boons. On the development side I would say it was bad at times because of the little amount of manpower we had to work with, being half the amount of people a lot of the other bachelor groups were. We do however think that on the side of communication it was easier for us. This because we were less people to account for and less opinions to keep track of. I have several times used trello or other boards as a way to keep track of tasks needed to be done, and to keep track of work we need to do during sprints and the likes. Under the bachelor however, we opted away from this. Our reasons for this were a couple. Firstly, and probably most importantly, we thought the reward for keeping the board fed and updated was more work than needed for two people, and secondly, we felt the communication channels we already were using were adequate. 

So what we ended up using was mainly discord, where we created our own chat for tracking work, talking about ideas and keeping track of notes and documents. We also had a work diagram we went through every five weeks to see if we were on track, what was left, what we were going to do in the next sprint and what we had to cut. These two have felt sufficient for us through the entire process. Now, i don’t think this is a valid route to go for everyone as a discord channel can get cluttered very fast with multiple people. But we do think this was a valid option for our 2 man team.   

**Use of version control systems, ticket tracking, branching, version control**

On the basis of using git and keeping a version control, using branching and the like i am very positive about it. I (the writer) personally use this in all the projects I can, but the group decided not to focus much time on this during the project. There are a few reasons why we have not used git much. The big one is that we have continuously met difficulties with the uploading of large files from Unity using git. This was a big deterrent for us to continue developing with it. We have also heard and experienced in earlier private and school projects the quirky nature of merge conflicts when pushing unity projects, and the experience of sitting late on a game jam, having all the last work disappear because of merge conflicts doing this is vivid in my imagination. We also have the issue of github not letting you upload files over a certain size on a free account. This last one can be avoided by using the schools gitlab and upload there, but there it requires ssh keys to upload this big a files, and while that is very doable it was yet another reason we got scared off due to non of us being familiar with ssh keys as we both had been using https up to this point. It was all in all reasons why we felt using git would be more of a hassle than a boon. 

We also felt like the way we worked was adequate without the need for version control. We generally only worked in separate scenes, except during the first month when we needed to develop the first part of our project. We have been developing a VR project, which has kept us largely locked to the VR lab. This made it so we didn’t have a need for being able to clone projects over several computers, and the very few times we needed to do this we could just use a large usb device. 

This does not mean there isn’t generally a very good idea to use git. The ability to go back to older, functioning parts of the project in case you break everything is a very positive thing, but we haven’t felt the need for it in our two man project. There is also the ability to track what has been done and where bugs have been introduced, but again, this has been largely avoided by the fact that we are only two, which for the most part have been working in different scenes all the time. One place we do miss the power of git is to have specific notes to go back to during the writing of our report. This is because it is harder than anticipated to remember when some of our functionality was done or changed.
